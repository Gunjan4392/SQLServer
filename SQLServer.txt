*     SQL Server uses three-valued logic, which can be troublesome for programmers accustomed to the more satisfying two-valued logic           (TRUE or FALSE) most programming languages use.  
      In SQL Server, however, if a column value is NULL, its neither of true neither false. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the           third value in three-valued logic: UNKNOWN.
*     UNION is more costly than UNION ALL as UNION gives distinct values betweent two tables where as UNION ALL returns duplicate values         as well.


1.    Given a table TBL with a field Nmbr that has rows with the following values: (1, 0, 0, 1, 1). Write a query to add 2 where Nmbr is 0        and add 3 where Nmbr is 1
A.    update TBL set Nmbr = case when Nmbr = 0 then Nmbr+2 else Nmbr+3 end;

2.    Write a SQL query to find the 10th highest employee salary from an Employee table.
A.    SELECT TOP (1) Salary FROM 
        (SELECT DISTINCT TOP (10) Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC) 
      AS Emp ORDER BY Salary
